# zkstarks

This is a literate implementation of zkSTARKs based on the recent tutorials
by [StarkWare](https://github.com/starkware-industries/stark101).

## Usage

The program will take some time to run polynomial interpolation and evaluation
are the most costly operations

```sh
go run cmd/main.go
```
